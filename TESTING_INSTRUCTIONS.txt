INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY THE FIX
===============================

The fix has been successfully applied to utils/measurements.py.
The diagnostic test confirms it's working (10,000 m² for test square).

TO SEE THE FIX IN THE GUI:
--------------------------

1. Make sure NO Python/GeoWizard processes are running
   - Check Task Manager for python.exe processes
   - Close any existing GeoWizard windows

2. Start GeoWizard fresh:
   
   python main.py

3. Enter your polygon coordinates:
   
   9510915.49, 7192020.34
   9511397.85, 7192284.40
   9511536.87, 7192119.00
   9511133.88, 7191775.31
   9510915.49, 7192020.34  (closing duplicate - this is OK now!)

4. Check the measurements panel

EXPECTED RESULTS:
-----------------
Before the fix:
- Area: ~30,889 m² (WRONG - 2.5x too high)
- Perimeter: ~749 m (WRONG - 25% too high)

After the fix:
- Area: ~12,000-13,000 m² (CORRECT - matches Google Earth ~12,432 m²)
- Perimeter: ~590-600 m (CORRECT - matches Google Earth ~598 m)

NOTE: Small differences may remain due to:
- Web Mercator to UTM conversion
- Geodesic vs planar calculation methods
- Zone/hemisphere settings

But the 2.5x area error should be GONE!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If you still see the old values (30,889 m² area):
1. Close ALL Python windows
2. Delete __pycache__ folders:
   Get-ChildItem -Path . -Include __pycache__ -Recurse -Force | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
3. Restart fresh

If the values are CLOSE (12,000-13,000 m²) but not exact:
- This is NORMAL - coordinate system conversion introduces small variations
- As long as it's NOT 30,889 m², the fix is working!
